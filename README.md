### **🔹 Level 2 – Restuarent Data Analysis & feature engeneering**
- Table booking & online delivery comparison
- Price range distribution & rating insights
- Online delivery behavior by pricing
- created new features
- lastly updated the dataset for modelling 

📁 Files:
- `Level_2_Notebook.ipynb`
- `Level_2_Summary.pdf`
- `README.txt`

---

### **🔹 Level 3 – predictive modelling & customer preference analysis**
- loaded the engineered dataset from level 2 
- Build a random forest regressor model and decision tree regressor to predict the
aggregate rating of a restaurant based on
available features.
- compared their performance using metrics : MAE, MSE, and R²
- did hyper parameter tuning for both models 
- selected metric :  refit = R² 

In customer preference analysis:
- We Identified the most popular cuisines among
customers based on the number of votes.
-  Average rating for each cuisine
-  Analyse the Relationship btw the type of
cuisine and restaurants rating using boxplot mainly To see quality consitency of the cuisine.

- `Dataset.csv`
- `final_level3_dataset.csv`
- `README.txt`
